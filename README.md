# Working hours counter

Working hours counter is a project focusing on autonomization of taking notes for work. 

## Installation

Download 'main.py' and 'Working Hours.xlsx' to the same file directory.

## Warning!

Do not change the directory of the files, name of the .xlsx file, nor sheet name.</br>
You can change the name only if you change it in code too.

## Usage

Once you run the python script, time starts counting.</br> You can add note after ending the session by 'end' command.</br> Your working time should be then added to the .xlsx file.</br> There is no problem using this script multiple times a day, your working time will be added up to the previous time(s) and note will be also added. Notes are being split by '|' character.  

## Additional note

You can manually edit the .xlsx file although the cells are locked.</br> There is no password set for the 'unprotect sheet' option.
